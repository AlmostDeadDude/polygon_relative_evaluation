  <h2>Qualification Task (Archived)</h2>
  <p>This project originally ran on large-scale crowdsourcing platforms where thousands of workers participated. To ensure quality, we asked new workers to complete a short qualification task before accessing the full jobs. The task mirrored the core experience you see in the demo: compare three tree polygons and rank them from best to worst.</p>
  <p>For portfolio purposes the qualification gate is removed. Anyone can load a random job directly from the main demo and explore the interface without restrictions.</p>
  <h3>How It Worked Back Then</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>We curated example selections with clear right/wrong answers.</li>
    <li>Automatic checks granted access only after the correct order was submitted.</li>
    <li>Qualified contributors received paid batches containing multiple rating tasks and a hidden control item.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you would like to jump straight into the interactive portion, head back to the main task.</p>
